### _Epicodus: Android (Week 1: Monday, Madlibs)_

#### By _[**Caleb Stevenson**](https://github.com/CGrahamS)_

## Description

* Practice in passing user input from one activity to another.
* The MainActivity presents several inputs for different kinds of words.
* The user fills out the words and selects which story they would like the words to fill out.
* We also chose to store our strings inside the resource file so we could practice consolidating our hard coded strings.
